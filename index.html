<h1>Karl Stolley: Background and Ambitions</h1>

<p>
  I’m the instructor for COM327/COM530: Standards-Based Web Design. But that doesn’t mean I don’t
  have ambitions.
</p>
<p>
  But first, my background: I have been creating things for the web since 1998, when as an
  undergraduate student I created my first web page, “The Infinite Page,” to share a paper I’d
  written about David Foster Wallace’s <cite>Infinite Jest</cite> and would present at my first
  academic conference in 1999. I’ve had a personal/profesional web presence in some form or another
  since about 2000, when I started graduate school.
</p>
<p>
  I used shoddy tools to build sites for most of those early years (Netscape Composer; Microsoft
  Frontpage, and eventually Macromedia/Adobe Dreamweaver). It wasn’t until I became webmaster of
  Purdue’s Online Writing Lab (OWL) around 2003 that I started to take web design seriously enough
  to write HTML and CSS by hand. Writing HTML and CSS by hand was itself mostly a product of
  building a custom content management system (CMS) to power the OWL. There was no Dreamweaver-like
  WYSIWYG to build the thing I wanted to build using PHP and MySQL.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve taught Standards-Based Web Design longer and more frequently than any other course I
  regularly teach. I moonlight as a full-stack developer, doing both front-end design like we’ll be
  doing in this class as well as back-end design (primarily in Node.js and Ruby on Rails), which is
  the focus in my follow-up class, Web Application Development.
</p>
<p>
  Which brings me to my ambitions: I think writing and designing things for the Web is the most
  important digital thing anyone can do. Although creating things using other people’s sites and
  tools (think Facebook/Twitter; think Microsoft Word, etc.) can be powerful, as can designing for
  specific platforms like iOS or Android, the Web is unrivaled in the ways that it forces you to
  think about reaching the most diverse digital audience possible. Not everyone has an iPhone. Not
  everyone has a high-speed internet connection at home. But anyone with any internet-connected
  device <em>does</em> have a Web browser. It might not be the latest and greatest, but with
  artistry and skill and some necessary technical knowledge, you can still create an experience for
  that user even as you design for other users who <em>do</em> have the lastest and greatest
  devices.
</p>
<p>
  To underscore my belief that this work of creating for the Web is so important, I have two primary
  ambitions beyond doing the best job I can as your professor. The first is, in a maxim used by
  open-source developers, to eat my own dog food: I will be completing the assignments I’ve assigned
  students this semester, on the same timeline and with the same deadlines and requirements. The
  second ambition I have is to revitalize and reboot the companion site for my book, the
  unfortunately-titled <cite>How to Design and Write Web Pages Today</cite>. I will be rereading the
  book and posting my notes on it (as well as reflections on our class and its meetings, etc.) at a
  dedicated Tumblr blog,
  <a href="http://teachingwebdesign.tumblr.com/">http://teachingwebdesign.tumblr.com/</a>
</p>
<p>
  My professional web presence is at <a href="http://karlstolley.com/">http://karlstolley.com/</a>
  (and it will be getting a makeover this semester as part of the web-presence projects) and I’m on
  Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/karlstolley">@karlstolley</a>. I’ve been relatively quiet
  on Twitter over the summer, but now that it’s fall and school’s back in session, I’m talking
  myself to being noisier on there again.
